        <ol>
          <li>
            The objective of the game, called <strong>Tin Can Rally</strong>, is to capture tokens from your opponents.
          <li>
            Before a match begins, participating teams must:
            <ul>
              <li>Present their robot in the staging area, adjacent to the arena, before the scheduled close of staging time. The staging area will be clearly marked on the day.
              <li>Place their robot in the starting area that they are assigned. The robot must be placed such that it is entirely within this starting area, with no parts overhanging its boundary. Its orientation does not matter.
              <li>Vacate the arena 40 seconds before the scheduled start time. During the 40 second period prior to the start of the match there must be no interaction with the robot.
              <li>Follow the directions of the match officials.
            </ul>
            Teams that fail to comply with these rules – such as by arriving late – may forfeit the match, at the discretion of the judge.
          <li>
            The game is played between <strong>four</strong> robots.
          <li>
            Each match lasts for <strong>150</strong> seconds.
          <li>
            Robots will be started by, or at the direction of, match officials.
          <li>
            There is a bonus point available for a robot fully leaving its scoring zone for the first time in a game.
          <li>
            Robots start inside the starting area within their scoring zone.
          <li>
            At the end of the match the robot with the most points wins.
          <li>
            The arena is a square of the design specified in
            <a href="#specifications">the specifications section</a>.
          <li>
            A match may be terminated prematurely if all teams participating in that match state to the match officials that they are happy for the game to end.
        </ol>

          <li>
            All robots must be safe.
          <li>
            The judge's decision is final.
          <li>
            Teams must conduct themselves within the principles of good sporting conduct.
          <li>
            Any assistance from Smallpeice Trust staff and volunteers is provided without guarantees.
          <li>
            No remote control systems or radio transmitters or receivers are permitted.
          <li>
            While accidental bumps and scrapes are inevitable, the sport is non-contact.
          <li>
            Robots must pass a safety inspection before they can enter a physical arena.
          <li>
            Robots must not deliberately or negligently damage the arena or anything in it.
          <li>
            Robots must have a mass of less than 10kg.
          <li>
            Robots must not intentionally damage anything inside the arena. At the discretion of the judge, teams who deliberately engage in collisions or take insufficient precautions against collisions may be penalised, including disqualification from rounds and deduction of league points.
          <li>
            Robots must fit within a 500mm ✖️ 500mm ✖️ 500mm cube at the start of each match.
          <li>
            Robots must fit within a 500mm ✖️ 750mm ✖️ 750mm cube, with one 750mm axis vertical,

            protection from mechanical damage.
          <li>
            Robots must not have any devices designed to produce noise except where included
            in the SourceBots kit.
          <li>
            Robots must not have any fiducial markers visible to other robots.
          <li>
            Robots must have a spare USB slot accessible to match officials.
          <li>
            Robots must have a power switch, obvious and on top, which will completely immobilise
            the robot.
          <li>
            Robots must not have any sharp edges or points.
        </ol>
        <p>
          Violations of these regulations will result in penalties, including deductions
          of points or outright disqualification.

        <p>
          The arena is labelled with fiducial markers. Each marker pattern encodes a number. Each marker number is associated with a particular feature within the arena, and also has an associated size.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two sets of marker codes will be used: one for development purposes, and one for the competition itself. The competition set is only to be used inside the SourceBots arena at the SourceBots competition. This is so that people carrying markers past the arena do not confuse robots. The competition codes are 100 above the development codes. When run in competition mode, the software provided by SourceBots will subtract 100 from the detected marker codes, as well as ignore the development codes. Markers outside of the ranges used in the game will also be ignored.

          The markers can be printed on a black-and-white printer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twenty eight arena wall markers are positioned around the perimeter of the arena with the marker codes incrementing in a clockwise fashion. The corners are counted in a clockwise fashion, with corner 0 being the corner closest to arena marker 0.

            The above figure represents, to scale, a birds eye view of the arena. The arena is
            <strong>5.75m</strong> square.
          <li>
            The floor of the arena is covered with a closed-loop, short pile carpet.
          <li>
            The perimeter of the arena floor is delimited by the arena wall, which has a minimum height of 100mm.
          <li>
            Each wall of the arena features seven 200mm AprilTag markers.
          <li>
            Each robot will be assigned a corner at the start of every match to indicate its scoring zone.
          <li>
            Starting areas are 1000 ±50mm squares within their respective scoring zones and will be marked by tape.
          <li>
            The green boxes denote the robot start locations. Robots may start facing any direction.
          <li>
            In the centre of the arena is a square plinth with cruciform arms extending from the centre of each side.
            The plinth is 75 ±20mm high.
            The square centre of the plinth has side length 600 ±50mm.
            The arms of the plinth are 2000 ±50mm long and 50 ±20mm wide.
          <li>
            The top and sides of the plinth will be solid.
          <li>
            SourceBots reserves the right to have match officials in the arena during games.

        <h3><a class="anchor" id="scoring-zone-specification"></a>Scoring Zones</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The arena is equally divided in to four square scoring zones, each with side length 2875mm ±100mm.
          <li>
            The boundary between scoring zones will be marked by 48mm coloured tape.
            For scoring purposes the tape is considered "in" both zones that it separates.

        <ol>
          <li>
            Tokens are "single wall" cuboid cardboard boxes.
          <li>
            Tokens will be arranged as shown in the <a href="#arena-specification">arena specification</a>.

        <h2><a class="anchor" id="comp-structure"></a>Competition Structure</h2>
        <p>
          The competition is structured in two phases:
            the <strong>main league</strong>
            and the <strong>knockout</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3><a class="anchor" id="matches"></a>Matches</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            At the end of a game, league points will be awarded as follows. The team with the most
            game points will be awarded 8 points towards the competition league. The team with the
            second most will be awarded 6. The team with the third most will be awarded 4 points,
            and the team with the fewest game points will be awarded 2 points. Teams whose robot
            was not entered into the round, or who were disqualified from the round, will be awarded
            no points.
          <li>
            Tied robots will be awarded the average of the points that their combined positions would
            be awarded. Thus, three robots tied for first place would receive 6 points each (since this
            is (8 + 6 + 4) ÷ 3).
          <li>
            At the end of the leagues, positions in the leagues are used to seed a
            knockout. This will be used to determine the final 1<sup>st</sup>,
            2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> awards.
          <li>
            In the event of a tie in a knockout match, the team that ranked highest in the league will
            go through.
