      <h2><a class="anchor" id="game-rules"></a>Game Rules</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The objective of the game, called <strong>Tin Can Rally</strong>, is to race around a track, picking up tin cans along the way.
        <li>
          Before a match begins, participating teams must:
          <ul>
            <li>Present their robot in the staging area, adjacent to the arena, before the scheduled close of staging time. The staging area will be clearly marked on the day.
            <li>Attach a <a href="#flag-specification">robot flag</a>. Robot flags will be provided by SourceBots officials in the staging area.
            <li>Place their robot in the starting area that they are assigned. The robot must be placed such that it is entirely within this starting area, with no parts overhanging its boundary. Its orientation does not matter.
            <li>Vacate the arena 40 seconds before the scheduled start time. During the 40 second period prior to the start of the match there must be no interaction with the robot.
            <li>Follow the directions of the match officials.
          </ul>
          Teams that fail to comply with these rules – such as by arriving late – may forfeit the match, at the discretion of the judge.
        <li>
          The game is played between <strong>two</strong> robots.
        <li>
          Each match lasts for <strong>150</strong> seconds.
        <li>
          Robots will be started by, or at the direction of, match officials.
        <li>
          A point is awarded each time a robot crosses a scoring line in the anti-clockwise direction.
        <li>
          Robots can pick up tin cans which are in the track. For every can a robot is carrying when it crosses a scoring line, the number of points awarded is doubled.<br>For example, a robot carrying two cans is awarded four points.
        <li>
          At the end of each lap - defined as every sixth crossing of a scoring line in a forward direction - a robot is awarded an additional four points above the points it would normally get for the crossing.
        <li>
          At the end of a match, each robot is awarded <strong>two</strong> additional points for each tin can it is carrying.
        <li>
          A robot is deemed to have passed a scoring line when the back of the robot passes the line.
        <li>
          Cases of a robot passing backwards over a line are offset against future crossings forward of a line. That is, if a robot crosses over two track boundaries backwards, it will need to cross two track boundaries forwards before it can gain any more scoring line points.
        <li>
          At the end of the match the robot with the most points wins.
        <li>
          The arena is a square of the design specified in
          <a href="#specifications">the specifications section</a>.
        <li>
          A match may be terminated prematurely if all teams participating in that match state to the match officials that they are happy for the game to end.

        <li>
          Robots must have a spare USB slot accessible to match officials.
        <li>

      <h3><a class="anchor" id="marker-specification"></a>Markers</h3>
      <p>
        The arena is labelled with fiducial markers. Each marker pattern encodes a number. Each marker number is associated with a particular feature within the arena, and also has an associated size.
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Item</th>

        The markers can be printed on a black-and-white printer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eight arena wall markers are positioned around the arena as shown in the <a href="#arena-specification">arena specification</a>. Marker codes are mirrored on each side of the arena.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wall markers are placed such that the bottom of the marker is 20 ±5mm from the arena floor.

        <li>
          The above figure represents, to scale, a birds eye view of the arena. The arena is
          <strong>5.4m</strong> square.
        <li>
          The floor of the arena is covered with a closed-loop, short pile carpet.
        <li>
          The perimeter of the arena floor is delimited by the arena wall, which has a minimum height of 100mm.
        <li>
          Starting areas are 1000 ±50mm squares and will be marked by tape which is considered part of the starting area.
        <li>
          Starting area 0 is at the top of the arena diagram, and area 1 is at the bottom.
        <li>
          The green boxes denote a robot in their start locations, shown in yellow. Robots may start anywhere inside their starting area facing any direction.
        <li>
          The inner walls of the arena have a minimum height of 170mm.
        <li>
          SourceBots reserves the right to have match officials in the arena during games.

      <h3><a class="anchor" id="flag-specification"></a>Robot flags</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          A "robot flag" is a removable identifier that will be attached to a robot throughout a match. It features identifying areas to allow spectators to easily associate a robot with its starting area. The markings in the identifying areas are intentionally not specified.
        <li>
          Flags are not counted when considering the starting size of the robot.
        <li>
          The identifying part of the robot flag must be visible when attached to the mount.
        <li>
          The mounting cylinder must be permanently affixed to the main chassis of a robot, and vertical when the robot is in its typical stopped position.
      </ol>
      <h3><a class="anchor" id="can-specification"></a>Cans</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cans are cylindrical metallic containers weighing 300g ±20g.
        <li>
          Cans are 67mm ±3mm in diameter with a height of 100mm ±5mm.
        <li>
          Cans will be arranged as shown in the <a href="#arena-specification">arena specification</a>.
        <li>
          Cans are electrically conductive and ferromagnetic.

      <h2><a class="anchor" id="comp-structure"></a>Competition Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The competition is structured in two phases:
          the <strong>main league</strong>
          and the <strong>knockout</strong>.
      </p>
      <h3><a class="anchor" id="matches"></a>Matches</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the end of a game, league points will be awarded as follows. The team with the most
          game points will be awarded 8 points towards the competition league. The team with the
          second most will be awarded 6. Teams whose robot
          was not entered into the round, or who were disqualified from the round, will be awarded
          no points.
        <li>
          If a match ends in a tie, robots will be awarded the average of the points that their combined
          positions would be awarded, in this case 7 (since this is (8 + 6) &div; 2).
        <li>
          At the end of the leagues, positions in the leagues are used to seed a
          knockout. This will be used to determine the final 1<sup>st</sup>,
          2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> awards.
        <li>
          In the event of a tie in a knockout match, the team that ranked highest in the league will
          go through.
