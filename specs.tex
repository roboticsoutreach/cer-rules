\subsection{Markers}
\refstepcounter{SpecID}
\label{spec:markers}

The arena, and tokens, are labelled with fiducial markers. Each
marker number is associated with a particular feature in the arena,
and also has an associated size.  The marker numbers and sizes are
as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Item} & \textbf{Marker Number} & \textbf{Marker Size (\si{mm})} \\
  \midrule
  Arena boundary & 0 -- 27 & 250 \\
  Central reservation & 28 -- 39 & 250  \\
  % 28 to 31 reserved for robot badges
  Tokens & 100 -- 199 & 80 \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Arena}
\refstepcounter{SpecID}
\label{spec:arena}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The arena floor is an \SI{8}{m} $\times$ \SI{8.1}{m} rectangle. The
        tolerance of these two dimensions is $\pm$ \SI{250}{mm}.
  \item The floor of the arena is carpeted.
  \item The layout of the arena is given in Figure~\ref{fig:arena}.
  \item The outer walls of the arena are at least \SI{600}{mm} high, and the
        interior surface is white plastic-coated hardboard.
  \item The outer track of the arena is \SI{1.5}{m} wide along the \SI{8}{m}
        edges, and \SI{1.55}{m} wide along the \SI{8.1}{m} edges.
  \item The central reserved area is surrounded by walls at least \SI{179}{mm}
        high.
  \item The starting location of the robots is given in Figure~\ref{fig:arena}.
        Teams are allowed to place their robot anywhere such that the entire
        robot is within \SI{1}{m} of the starting point, which will be
        indicated on the floor of the arena.

  \item The track boundaries are visually delineated on the floor of the arena
        by tape. The actual boundary is on the trailing edge of the tape --
        that is, a robot has passed the boundary when the back of the robot
        is past the tape.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tin Cans}
\refstepcounter{SpecID}
\label{spec:cans}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The tin cans are standard 400g steel tin cans, of height \SI{108}{mm}
        ($\pm$ \SI{5}{mm}), and radius \SI{75}{mm} ($\pm$ \SI{5}{mm}).
  \item The initial layout of tokens in the arena is given in
        Figure~\ref{fig:arena}.
  \item The tin cans are ferromagnetic.
\end{enumerate}
