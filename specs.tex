\subsection{Arena}
\refstepcounter{SpecID}
\label{spec:arena}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The arena floor is an \SI{8.4}{m} $\times$ \SI{8.4}{m} rectangle. The
        tolerance of these two dimensions is $\pm$ \SI{250}{mm}.
  \item The floor of the arena is carpeted.
  \item The layout of the arena is given in Figure~\ref{fig:arena}. This
        figure is to scale.
  \item The outer walls of the arena are at least \SI{600}{mm} high, and the
        interior surface is white plastic-coated hardboard.
  \item Each of scoring zones is \SI{2.4}{m} $\times$ \SI{2.4}{m} $\pm$ \SI{100}{mm},
        resulting in a total size of \SI{4.8}{m} $\times$ \SI{4.8}{m} $\pm$ \SI{200}{mm}
        for the four scoring zones.
  \item Scoring zones are bounded by metallic tape around the perimeter
        and internal boundaries. The inside edge of the tape marks the outside
        edge of the scoring zone.
  \item The raised area in the centre of the arena is \SI{2.4}{m} $\times$ \SI{2.4}{m} $\pm$ \SI{100}{mm},
        with a height of \SI{180}{mm} $\pm$ \SI{10}{mm}.
  \item At the cardinal points of the arena are \SI{1.2}{m} $\times$ \SI{1.2}{m} $\pm$ \SI{100}{mm} walls,
        at least \SI{180}{mm} $\pm$ \SI{10}{mm} tall.
  \item Scoring zones for teams are offset 90\degree{} anti-clockwise, such
        that a team isn't directly in front of their own scoring zone.
  \item Each robot will be assigned a corner at the start of every match to indicate its starting area.
        Corner starting areas are \SI{1000}{mm} $\pm$ \SI{20}{mm} square and will be marked by tape.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tokens}
\refstepcounter{SpecID}
\label{spec:tokens}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Tokens are cuboids with side length \SI{260}{mm} $\pm$ \SI{15}{mm}.
  \item The exterior surface of the tokens is conductive and fully connected.
  \item There are 20 possible starting positions for tokens in the arena. These
        are arranged as indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:arena}.
  \item At the start of each match, four of the starting positions in each quadrant
        will be occupied. The position nearest the starting area of each quadrant
        will always be occupied.
  \item While the token starting positions are rotationally symmetrical, the
        pattern of which are occupied in any given match may not be.
\end{enumerate}
