\section{Game Rules}
\label{sec:rules}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game, called \emph{\gamename}, is played in the arena defined in
        Specification~\ref{spec:arena}. The objective is to collect tokens and
        deposit them in the teams scoring zone.
  \item The arena contains 16 tokens.
  \item There are four scoring zones in the arena, arranged in a $2\times2$
        grid, with each robot being allocated a single scoring zone. The centre
        of the arena (approximately a quarter of each scoring zone) is raised.
  \item At the end of the match, tokens earn points as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item 1 point for tokens `in the control of' a robot.
      \item 2 points for tokens `in' a teams' scoring zone.
      \item 5 points for tokens `on' the raised area of a teams' scoring zone.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Tokens are considered to be `in the control of' a robot if and only if:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Fewer than 3 corners are in contact with the floor.
      \item When the robot is lifted, the token remains held by the robot.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item A token is considered to be `in' a zone if either:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item at least three corners of the token are in contact with the floor.
      \item the token is in contact only with the floor of the zone and any part
            of the raised area within the zone.
      \item the token is in contact only with other tokens which are `in' the zone.
            In the case where several such tokens are in mutual contact (and not in
            contact with anything else), all those tokens are `in' the zone.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item A token is considered to be `on' the raised area if either:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item at least three corners of the token are in contact with the top
            surface of the raised area.
      \item the token is in contact only with the top surface of the raised area.
      \item the token is in contact only with other tokens which are `on' the raised area.
            In the case where several such tokens are in mutual contact (and not in
            contact with anything else), all those tokens are `on' the raised area.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item If, at the end of the match, a robot is anywhere on the top of the
        raised area then they earn an additional 30 points.
  \item During a match, a robot may move or interact with any token in the arena.
  \item Participating teams must present their robots to match officials before
        the start of matches, as regulated by the match officials. Non-compliant
        teams may be disallowed from participating.
  \item There will be 4 robots in each match.
  \item \org may have any number of match officials within the arena, including
        during the course of matches.
  \item At the start of each match, robots must be entirely within their
        starting areas.
  \item At the start of each match, teams will be permitted to lean into the
        arena and start their robots.
  \item Each match lasts $120$ seconds.
  \item Teams may be disqualified from one or all matches by match officials,
        for non-compliance with regulations, lateness to the match, or any other
        reason at the discretion of the judge. Teams disqualified before the
        start time of a match will not be permitted to enter a robot.
\end{enumerate}
