\section{Game Rules}
\label{sec:rules}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game, called \emph{\gamename}, is played in the arena defined in
        Specification~\ref{spec:arena}. The objective is to collect tokens and
        deposit them in the teams scoring zone.
  \item The arena contains 16 tokens.
  \item At the end of the game, tokens earn points as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item 1 point for tokens in the control of a robot.
      \item 2 points for tokens in a teams' scoring zone.
      \item 5 points for tokens on the raised area.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item At the end of the match, if a robot is on top of the raised area, they'll
        receive an additional 30 points.
  \item An additional bonus point is awarded if a robot moves out of its starting
        zone.
  \item A token is in a scoring zone if, and only if, it has three corners in contact
        with the floor in the zone, or with the top surface of the raised area.
  \item If a token only has 2 corners on the raised area, but the other 2 are over
        a scoring zone, the token is considered in the base scoring zone, scoring 2 points.
  \item Participating teams must present their robots to match officials before
        the start of matches, as regulated by the match officials. Non-compliant
        teams may be disallowed from participating.
  \item There will be 4 robots in each match.
  \item \org may have any number of match officials within the arena, including
        during the course of matches.
  \item At the start of each match, robots must be entirely within their
        starting zones.
  \item At the start of each match, teams will be permitted to lean into the
        arena and start their robots.
  \item Each match lasts $120$ seconds.
  \item Teams may be disqualified from one or all matches by match officials,
        for non-compliance with regulations, lateness to the match, or any other
        reason at the discretion of the judge. Teams disqualified before the
        start time of a match will not be permitted to enter a robot.
\end{enumerate}
