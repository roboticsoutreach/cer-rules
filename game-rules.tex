\section{Game Rules}
\label{sec:rules}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game, called \emph{\gamename}, is played in the arena defined in
        Specification~\ref{spec:arena}. The objective is to collect tokens and
        deposit them in scoring zones.
  \item The arena contains 24 tokens.
  \item There are nine scoring zones in the arena, arranged in a $3\times3$
        grid. The central scoring zone is raised.
  \item A scoring zone is considered to be `controlled' by a team if and only if:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item the team has tokens in the zone.
      \item no other team has a greater than, or equal to number of tokens in the zone.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item A `region' is defined as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A `region' is a group of directly adjacent scoring zones controlled by the same team.
      \item The size of a `region' is calculated by counting the number of scoring zones within the region.
      \item If the central scoring zone is within a `region', the size of the region is increased by one.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item At the end of a match, tokens earn points as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item 1 point for tokens `in the control of' a robot.
      \item $n^2$ points where $n$ is the size of every controlled region.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Tokens are considered to be `in the control of' a robot if and only if:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item fewer than 3 corners are in contact with the floor, and
      \item when the robot is lifted, the token remains held by the robot.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item A token is considered to be `in' a zone if the vertical projection of token
        is entirely within the scoring zone.
  \item A token is considered to be `half in' a zone if the vertical projection of token
        is partially within the scoring zone.
  \item A token is not in any scoring zone if it is in the control of a robot.
  \item A token is considered to be `on' a raised area if it is in contact with
        the top surface of the raised area.
  \item During a match, a robot may move or interact with any token in the arena.
  \item Participating teams must present their robots to match officials before
        the start of matches, as regulated by the match officials. Non-compliant
        teams may be disallowed from participating.
  \item There will be up to 4 robots in each match.
  \item \org may have any number of match officials within the arena, including
        during the course of matches.
  \item At the start of each match, robots must be entirely within their
        starting areas.
  \item At the start of each match, teams will be permitted to lean into the
        arena and start their robots.
  \item Each match lasts $120$ seconds.
  \item Teams may be disqualified from one or all matches by match officials,
        for non-compliance with regulations, lateness to the match, or any other
        reason at the discretion of the judge. Teams disqualified before the
        start time of a match will not be permitted to enter a robot.
\end{enumerate}
