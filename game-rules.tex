\section{Game Rules}
\label{sec:rules}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game, called \emph{\gamename}, is played in the arena defined in
        Specification~\ref{spec:arena}. The objective is to collect tokens and
        deposit them in scoring zones.
  \item The arena contains 24 tokens.
  \item There are nine scoring zones in the arena, arranged in a $3\times3$
        grid.
  \item A scoring zone is considered to be `controlled' by a team if and only if:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item the team has tokens in the zone.
      \item no other team has a greater `weighting of tokens' in the zone.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item The `weighting of tokens' in a zone for a team is calculated from the sum of token weights in the zone.
      Token weights are determined as follows:
      \begin{enumerate}
            \item A token `fully in' the zone has a weighting of $2$.
            \item A token `partially in' the zone has a weighting of $1$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item A `controlled region' is defined as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A `controlled region' is a group of directly adjacent scoring zones controlled by the same team.
      \item A scoring zone may only be part of a single controlled region.
      \item The value of a `controlled region' is calculated by summing the value of all zones within the `controlled region'.
      \item All scoring zones have a value of exactly $1$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item At the end of a match, robots earn points as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $1$ point for moving entirely out of the starting area.
      \item $n^2$ points for each `controlled region' where $n$ is the value of the `controlled region'.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item A token is considered to be `fully in' a zone if the vertical projection of token
        is entirely within the scoring zone.
  \item A token is considered to be `partially in' a zone if the vertical projection of token
        is partially within the scoring zone.
  \item During a match, a robot may move or interact with any token in the arena.
  \item Participating teams must present their robots to match officials before
        the start of matches, as regulated by the match officials. Non-compliant
        teams may be disallowed from participating.
  \item There will be up to 4 robots in each match.
  \item \org may have any number of match officials within the arena, including
        during the course of matches.
  \item At the start of each match, robots must be entirely within their
        starting areas.
%   \item At the start of each match, teams will be permitted to lean into the
%         arena and start their robots.
  \item Each match lasts $120$ seconds.
  \item Teams may be disqualified from one or all matches by match officials,
        for non-compliance with regulations, lateness to the match, or any other
        reason at the discretion of the judge. Teams disqualified before the
        start time of a match will not be permitted to enter a robot.
\end{enumerate}
