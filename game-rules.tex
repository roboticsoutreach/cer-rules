\section{Game Rules}
\label{sec:rules}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game, called \emph{\gamename}, is played in the arena defined in
        Specification~\ref{spec:arena}. The objective is to collect tokens, and
        to bring them to one's scoring zone.
  \item The arena contains sixteen tokens. The layout is detailed in
        Specification~\ref{spec:arena}. Each token is worth 2 points.
  \item In the centre of the arena, on a raised platform, is a special poison
        token, which has the effect of nullifying the scores in a zone.
  \item At the end of the game, each robot is awarded the sum of the value of
        all tokens entirely within their scoring zone, unless that scoring zone
        contains the poison token. If the zone contains the poison token, no
        points are awarded.
  \item An additional two bonus points are awarded for any movement from the
        start position of a robot.\footnote{This can be awarded regardless of
        the presence of a poison token.}
  \item A token is in a scoring zone if, and only if, all the following
        conditions are met:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item At least three of its corners are in contact with the floor in
                the zone\footnote{Note that this means tokens on the central
                platform are \emph{not} in any zone.},
          \item It remains on the floor even if any robot touching it is lifted.
        \end{enumerate}
  \item Participating teams must present their robots to match officials at
        least one minute before the start of each match. They will be asked to
        place their robot in the arena, and vacate the arena at least 30 seconds
        before the official start time of the match.
  \item There will be up to 4 robots in each match.
  \item \org may have any number of match officials within the arena, including
        during the course of matches.
  \item At the start of each match, robots must be entirely within their
        starting zones.
  \item At the start of each match, teams will be permitted to lean into the
        arena and start their robots.
  \item Each match lasts $180$ seconds.
  \item At the end of each match, teams must wait for instructions to collect
        their robots or risk disqualification. This is in order to give match
        officials time to record scores.
  \item Teams may be disqualified from one or all matches by match officials,
        for non-compliance with regulations, lateness to the match, or any other
        reason at the discretion of the judge. Teams disqualified before the
        start time of a match will not be permitted to enter a robot.
\end{enumerate}
