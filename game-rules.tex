\section{Game Rules}
\label{sec:rules}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game, called \emph{\gamename}, is played in the arena defined in
        Specification~\ref{spec:arena}. The objective is to race around a
        track, picking up tin cans along the way.
  \item 6 points are awarded each time a robot crosses a track boundary in the
        anticlockwise direction.
  \item Robots can pick up tin cans which are in the track. Each time a robot
        crosses a track boundary and is awarded a track boundary point, it is
        awarded 4 bonus points for each tin can it is carrying.
  \item At every sixth track boundary, that is, every lap, a robot is awarded
        an additional 4 points above the 6 for the crossing.
  \item At the end of a match, each robot is awarded 2 additional points for
        each tin can it is carrying.
  \item A robot is deemed to have passed a track boundary when the back of the
        robot passes the line.
  \item Cases of a robot passing backwards over a line are offset against
        future crossings forward of a line. That is, if a robot crosses two
        track boundaries backwards, it will need to cross two track boundaries
        forwards before it can gain any more track boundary points.
  \item Participating teams must present their robots to match officials at
        least one minute before the start of each match.
  \item There will be 2 robots in each match.
  \item \org may have any number of match officials within the arena, including
        during the course of matches.
  \item At the start of each match, robots must be entirely within their
        starting zones.
  \item At the start of each match, teams will be permitted to lean into the
        arena and start their robots.
  \item Each match lasts $120$ seconds.
  \item Teams may be disqualified from one or all matches by match officials,
        for non-compliance with regulations, lateness to the match, or any other
        reason at the discretion of the judge. Teams disqualified before the
        start time of a match will not be permitted to enter a robot.
